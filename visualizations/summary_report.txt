MULTI-SOURCE DOMAIN ADAPTATION - RESULTS SUMMARY
Target Domain: Kitchen Reviews
================================================================================

1. SUPERVISED BASELINE
   - Best Accuracy: 95.35%
   - Training Strategy: Source domains only (Books, DVD, Electronics)
   - Total Epochs: 10

2. WS-UDA (Weighting Scheme based UDA)
   - Best Accuracy: 95.35%
   - Training Strategy: Adversarial training with domain weighting
   - Total Epochs: 10
   - Domain Weights:
     * Books: 35.0%
     * DVD: 34.0%
     * Electronics: 31.0%

3. 2ST-UDA (Two-Stage Training based UDA)
   - Best Accuracy: 94.25%
   - Training Strategy: Pre-train WS-UDA + Self-training with pseudo-labels
   - Stage 1 (WS-UDA): 10 epochs
   - Stage 2 (Self-training): Confidence-based pseudo-labeling + Fine-tuning

================================================================================
PERFORMANCE RANKING:
1. Supervised Baseline: 95.35%
2. WS-UDA: 95.35%
3. 2ST-UDA: 94.25%

OBSERVATIONS:
- All methods achieved >94% accuracy on target domain
- WS-UDA matched supervised performance (95.35% vs 95.35%)
- 2ST-UDA: 94.25% (slightly lower, possibly due to pseudo-label noise)
- Domain weighting shows balanced contribution from all source domains
